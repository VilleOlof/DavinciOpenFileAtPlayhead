# DavinciOpenFileAtPlayhead
Opens and selects the clip where the playhead is at in the explorer.  
Only works on Windows since it uses the command line and (what i assume) is windows specific command.

## Installation

Place the script into `%appdata%/Blackmagic Design/DaVinci Resolve/Support/Fusion/Scripts/Edit/`  
and it can be found inside davinci resolve at   
`Workspace>Scripts>OpenFileAtPlayhead`
